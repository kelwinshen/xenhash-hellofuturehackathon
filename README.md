# xenhash-hellofuturehackathon

We at XenHash are incredibly grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Hello Future Hackathon. This event has provided us with invaluable resources, guidance, and a platform to bring our vision to life using Hedera's powerful technology. The mentorship and support we've received from the Hedera team have been instrumental in helping us shape XenHash into a product that can truly make an impact. We look forward to continuing our journey with Hedera and contributing to the future of decentralized finance.

XenHash Building the Path to Real-World Utility

XenHash connects the gap between the Web3 ecosystem with real-world utility. With the increasing adoption of QRIS, there is a gap in facilitating direct payments from Web3 users to real-world merchants in Indonesia. Users often have to withdraw their funds or engage in peer-to-peer transactions to convert their crypto into fiat, leading to inefficient steps for making micropayments.

The vision of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a payment method has faced challenges in various regions, including Indonesia. Rather than circumventing regulations, we align with government policies by introducing HIDR, our stablecoin backed by Indonesian Rupiah fiat. XenHash will comply with regulations and engage in discussions with the government to establish legal frameworks, enabling broader adoption and can be used for direct payments to real-world merchants, effectively bridging the gap for Web3 users and simplifying micro transactions in Indonesia.
