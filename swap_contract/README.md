# Swap Contract

This repository contains a Solidity-based swap contract designed for the Hedera network. The contract facilitates the exchange between HBAR and HIDR tokens, leveraging price data from Supra Oracles. Due to the limited availability of a direct HBAR/IDR price feed, the conversion rate is derived using the HBAR/USD and USD/IDR pairs, ensuring an accurate HBAR/IDR exchange rate for transactions.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity programming knowledge
- Access to the Remix IDE
- A Hedera testnet account (can be obtained via [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com))

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment

1. Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).
2. Upload and set up the relevant smart contract files in the IDE.
3. Compile the contracts individually, ensuring that all contract dependencies are compatible with one another.

### 2. ABI and Bytecode Compilation

1. Once the contracts are successfully compiled, copy the ABI and bytecode generated by Remix.
2. Place the ABI and bytecode into the appropriate locations in your projectâ€™s `artifacts` directory.

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Ensure that you have the `dotenv` package installed by running:

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
2. Rename .env.sample to .env in your project directory.
3. Update the .env file with your private key and wallet address. If you don't have a Hedera testnet account, you can create one at Hedera Portal.


### 4. Testing the smartcontract

1. Run the following command to execute the test scripts and verify the smart contracts:
---------------------------
node main.js
---------------------------
2. Ensure that the transactions are processed correctly, and the smart contract functions as intended.
